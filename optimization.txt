Apart from using PreparedStatements and auto-commit off,

We used batch inserts and waited until the very end to execute the batch.
We also preferred data that we knew we would need at the very beginning such as 
existing genres and base movieId.
We also limited the amount of connections and statements that we created. By passing exisitng connections and statements through functions we saved time allocating and freeing resources.
